# SpongebobRecipeBook
I will be making a recipe book for the residents on Bikini Bottom. Spongebob’s recipe
book will be an API that will have various recipes seen and used in the Spongebob 
world for anybody to recreate. There are certain recipes that need to remain secret 
(Krabby Patty formula) so, in order to gain access to those recipes you’ll need 
special access privileges. The recipe book will have different users and based on the 
user’s status you can access certain recipes. There will be a single admin who makes
the decisions on who has access or not and they will be able to give special access 
to certain users. I will use Node.js, Express.js, RESTful methodology, Sequelize, 
MySQL, and Postman.
This API will allow:
● All users to register, login, and logout 
● Users to be able only to edit and delete recipes that are theirs
● Multiple users to associate their user ID with a recipe to view
● a user associated with a recipes to update
● Allow an admin user to have full CRUD access to all recipes and assign access level
to users
