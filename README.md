# SpongebobRecipeBook
This is a recipe book for the residents on Bikini Bottom. Spongebob’s recipe
book is an API that has various recipes seen and used in the Spongebob 
world for anybody to recreate. There are certain recipes that need to remain secret 
(Krabby Patty formula) so, in order to gain access to those recipes you’ll need 
special access privileges. The recipe book has different users and based on the 
user’s status you can access certain recipes. There is a single admin who makes
the decisions on who has access or not and they can give special access 
to certain users. This was built using Node.js, Express.js, RESTful methodology, Sequelize, 
MySQL, Bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens, and tested in Postman.
